    "This is the first of 4 Jupyter notebook python scripts that downloads and processes time-series data from European power systems. The notebooks have been used to create the [timeseries-datapackage](http://data.open-power-system-data.org/datapackage_timeseries/) that is available on the [Open Power System Data plattform](http://data.open-power-system-data.org/). A Jupyter notebook is a file that combines executable programming code with visualizations and comments in markdown format, allowing for an intuitive documentation of the code.\n",
