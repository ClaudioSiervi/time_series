    "# About Open Power System Data \n",
    "This notebook is part of the project Open Power System Data. Open Power System Data develops a platform for free and open data for electricity system modeling. We collect, check, process, document, and provide data that are publicly available but currently inconvenient to use. \n",
    "More info on Open Power System Data:\n",
    "- [Information on the project on our website](http://open-power-system-data.org)\n",
    "- [Data and metadata on our data platform](http://data.open-power-system-data.org)\n",

    "# About Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "A Jupyter Notebook is a file that combines executable programming code with visualizations and comments in markdown format, allowing for an intuitive documentation of the code. We use these as a single file for coding and documentation. [More info on our IT-concept](http://open-power-system-data.org/it)\n",
    "\n",
    "# About this datapackage\n",
    "The [timeseries-datapackage](http://data.open-power-system-data.org/datapackage_timeseries/) contains different kinds of timeseries data relevant for power system modelling, namely:\n",
    "- electricity consumption (load)\n",
    "- wind and solar power generation and available capacities\n",
    "- prices\n",
    "The main focus of this datapackage is German data, but we include data from other countries wherever possible.\n",
    "The timeseries become available at different points in time depending on the sources. The full dataset is only available from 2012 onwards.\n",
    "The data has been downloaded from the sources, resampled and merged in a large CSV file with hourly resolution. Additionally, the data available at a higher resolution (Some renewables in-feed, 15 minutes) is provided in a separate file.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Data sources\n",
    "The main data sources are the various European Transmission System Operators (TSOs) and the ENTSO-E Data Portal. A complete list of data sources is integrated in the Field Documentation of the [timeseries-datapackage](http://data.open-power-system-data.org/datapackage_timeseries/) \n",
